				This professional programme makes a new-concept methodology for the aesthetic treatment of all those disorders which spoil the appearance of the skin: wrinkles, dyschromias, hyperkeratotic and asphyxial skins, cicatricial marks, impurities, dehydration and �photoageing�. The PROFESSIONAL-20 PROGRAMME is based on a 20% concentration of glycolic acid. 
				<br><br>
				Size:	Case - 8 treatments
				
				</td>
				<td><b>Benefits:</b><br>As a consequence, by adjusting them to the type of skin in each particular case, the programme can not only cause a significant regression of the imperfection but can also ensure excellent tolerability. Indeed, as far as this latter aspect is concerned, the special carrying system of the glycolic acid used, i.e. the cyclodextrins, prevents any irritation, even in the case of particularly sensitive skins.
From the functional viewpoint, the distinctive features which characterize this professional programme are:
<ul>
<li>Progressive and long-lasting exfoliation in the horny layer thanks to the compound of glycolic acid and cyclodextrins. This combination ensures excellent results and great skin tolerability.
<li>A smoothing action on the epidermic surface, as the alkaline phosphate and Protease enzymes carried by the cyclodextrins act in conjunction with the glycolic acid, increasing its effect.
<li>Toning and stimulation of the skin produced by the supply of corallina officinalis, a glycolic extract with a high concentration of trace elements.
<li>An anti-wrinkle and moisturizing action exercised by collagen, ascorbic acid, panthenol and Mallow and Marigold extracts, which are the perfect regenerating elements after an exfoliating treatment.
<li>Absolute respect for the skin, even in cases of particularly sensitive types.
</ul></td>

				<td><b>Ingredients:</b><br>
				Content:
<li>Two 2.0 ml. vials 
<li>Two 15 ml. envelopes 
<li>One 10 ml. bottle
<li>One sealed bag with activated gauze.
<p>
SERUM-20: PH 3.5 GLYCOLIC ACID 20% (exfoliating)
OLIGOSERUM: PH 6.2 CORALLINA OFFICINALIS 5% (a stimulant for cell metabolism and the synthesis of protein fibres in the dermis)
MASK: PH 5.9 SOLUBLE COLLAGEN 2% (filming agent, moisturizer), <br>
GLYCOLIC EXTRACT 2:1 MALLOW 2% (moisturizer, emollient); GLYCOLIC EXTRACT 2:1 , MARIGOLD 1% (lenitive, emollient), D-PANTHENOL 0.5% (moisturizing, lenitive), ASCORBIC ACID 0.5% (toning, moisturizing, stimulant of collagen synthesis in the dermis)
SETTED�-10: PH 3.8. GLYCOLIC ACID IN CYCLODEXTRINS 10% ( a compound made up of a slow-release carrying system, i.e. cyclodextrins and a functional substance with an exfoliating action, i.e. glycolic acid)
SOLUTION FOR IMBIBING THE GAUZE IN A SEALED BAG: pH 5.5. ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE CYCLODEXTRINS 3% and CHERATASI CYCLODEXTRINS 2% (this compound is made up of a slow-release carrying system - the cyclodextrins - and of two proteolithic enzymes - the Alkaline phosphates and Protease - which exercise a keratolytic action and, as a result, have an emollient and smoothing effect on the epidermis).
<p>
<b>Applicatioin:</b> This programme is for professional use only. It has to be performed in weekly treatments over 8 weeks, although this may be increased to suit the subject�s particular case. The whole method is completed with a home-self care follow-up: one pot of SETTEDI-10 suitably diluted for 7 daily doses in between one treatment and another and the products of the PENTA line.
<p>
<b>Technical Features:</b> This programme provides the beautician with a basic treatment of glycolic acid and offers guarantee of success without any undesirable side-effects, even in subjects with a sensitive Cskin.
Indeed, treatments based on glycolic acid still today range among those which are most on demand at Beauty Centres not only for face but also for body programmes. Unfortunately, many end customers have had direct experience of the unpleasant effects of aggressive exfoliation and of the disadvantages of traditional glycolic acid: reddening, itching, dehydration, dryness, dermatitis and, in the worst of cases, even burns. A number of advantages may be obtained with PENTA with the use of cyclodextrins as vehicles for glycolic acid and for other active principles, such as enzymes and vitamins. These are:
<ul>
<li>increased adhesion of functional molecules to the skin
<li>gradual release of glycolic acid on the epidermis, longer resting time and deeper and more noticeable exfoliation in comparison to traditional methods based on glycolic acid.
<li>no irritation as a side-effect.
</ul>
Besides the above, it is possible to use two preparations with glycolic acid in different doses for the professional programme, and to choose from a vast range of products for home self-care, all of which makes this a particularly versatile innovative line to suit all types of skin.
<p>
The leaflet with a description of the method covers a range of 8 different cases of disorders that can be treated using a properly adjusted programme with the PENTA line, both professionally and for home self-care.
